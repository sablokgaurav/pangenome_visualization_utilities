# pangenome_visualization_utilities
a collection of pangenome visualization utilities to plot and visualize your gene occurences and also to see the dynamics of the pangenome. It uses orthomcl post run to plot and visualize pangenome. it also uses the graph based to visualize the graph pangenomes. These utilities include the following: 

1. Visualization of the pangenome conservation as a dotted bi-graph.
2. Virualization of the pangenome conservation.
3. Marked gene and genome coverage.
