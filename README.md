# pangenome_visualization_utilities
a collection of pangenome visualization utilities written in R, Python and Ruby to plot and visualize your gene occurences and also to see the dynamics of the pangenome. It uses orthomcl post run to plot and visualize pangenome. it also uses the graph based to visualize the graph pangenomes. These utilities include the following: 

1. Visualization of the pangenome conservation as a dotted bi-graph.
2. Virualization of the pangenome conservation.
3. Marked gene and genome coverage.
4. a streamlit application for mapping and visualization of pangenomes and corresponding genome tracts and also enables the datascience workflow. You can also create genome tracts and also the mapping for those tracts. It is a part of the docker long read genome assembly pangenome workflow.
